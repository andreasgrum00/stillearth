# Still Earth

A simple React site that shows you a random spot on Google Earth — places that are weird, funny, incredible or just plain WTF! 🌍😂

---

## What is it?

**Still Earth** picks a random point on the globe and throws you into Google Earth to explore some strange, funny, or curious location you probably never imagined existed.

---

## Tech used

- React  
- Google Earth embed
- TypeScript/TSX
- CSS

---

## How to run it

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andreasgrum00/stillearth.git
   ```
2. Go into the folder:
   ```bash
   cd stillearth
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

   ```
5. Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser and get ready to discover the weirdest/greatest places on Earth!

## How it works

- Every time you open the site (or hit the “random” button), it picks a random place between those in a list.
- It then embeds a Google Earth view centered on that location.
- Sometimes you'll land on a weird building, a giant rubber duck, or just... desert. That's the fun.
- There’s no logic to make sure it’s interesting — the chaos *is* the point.

---

## Future improvements

- Let users submit their own weird Earth spots 🛰️  
- Add a “history” of visited locations  
- Option to save favorites  
- Dark mode for your late-night weird place exploration  
- Mobile layout tweaks  
- Sound effects? 🤔
